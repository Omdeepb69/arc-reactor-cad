pygame (for UI and basic visualization/simulation)
requests (or specific library like 'openai' for LLM API calls)
Pillow (PIL) (for image handling)
OpenCV ('opencv-python') (optional, for image analysis feature)
Possibly a diagramming library like 'schemdraw' (for better circuit visualization if Pygame drawing becomes too complex)
